My name is Vitalii, Ukrainian by nationality, currently living in the Netherlands.

I am a Software Engineer with more than 12 years of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, I had a chance to try myself in different roles: from an Engineer to a Team Lead, Architect, Technical Product Owner and Engineering Manager. 

Also, I have spent a decent amount of time developing on Sitecore platform. For my community contributions, such as blogging and public speaking I have been awarded a [Sitecore MVP award](https://mvp.sitecore.com/en) 2 times in a row.
