My name is Vitalii, Ukrainian by nationality, currently living in the Netherlands.

I am an experienced .NET developer with great passion on crafting high quality software. Also, as an ex-Sitecorian, I have been working on several roles and projects within Sitecore: core product development (Sitecore 8), development of several modules (Social Connected, Komfo Connector) and technical support (I&#8217;ve probably replied on couple of your support tickets).

Together with Sitecore since version 5.3  ♥ 

Besides Sitecore, my specializations are: distributed applications, cloud technologies, Web API development and CI/CD. 

One day I decided that it&#8217;s time to give back to community and share some knowledge and thoughts I gained throughout my career of a software developer.

Hope you enjoy it and find something useful for yourself here.
